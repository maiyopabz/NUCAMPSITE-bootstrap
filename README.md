# NUCAMPSITE-bootstrap

week 1-2

Added an image to the "Featured Campsites" section and styled it using image and media object classes.
I create a reservation form and place it inside a Bootstrap card.
I create a button in the header jumbotron that when clicked, will scroll down to the reservation form. 

week 3

Updated the index.html with the following:

-Cause the "Reserve Campsite" button to activate a modal when clicked.
-Move the campsite reservation form into a modal. 
-Add a button group with the choices of "Tent" or "RV" to the reservation form. 

week 4 

Updated index.html, scripts.js, and styles.scss with the following:

-I converted the buttons that activate the Reserve and Login modals to use JavaScript (in the form of jQuery) instead of custom data-* attributes for activation.
-Updated the Sass file to include another color variable, and to use nesting to give different background colors to the headers of the two modals.
